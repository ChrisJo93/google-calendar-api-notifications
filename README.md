This repo is practice using google calendar api. The application itself is simply a button which adds a hard-coded event to the user's google calendar. 

Events could be made dynamically by altering the start, end, and recurrence objects of the addButton.js file lines 32-43. A form would be needed to supply these values.

The add button is styled using material-ui to add a bit of flair to an otherwise blank browser application.
